# Rmicrograd
Implementation of micrograd in R

Following Andrej Karpathy's great video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0

I am attempting to write the micrograd engine from scratch in R
Here's the linkt to the [Python] version of micrograd:
https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd

I am going to try and write this from the video rather than
translating the Python. For learning and stuff.
